SAVING PRINCESS MONONOKE
by @mjtwr

Princess Mononoke is an incredible movie by Studio Ghibli...one ofmy personal favorites,
it was the inspiration for the videogame's theme.

This is a classic heroe fighting against enemies game, our heroe is Prince Ashitaka and with the help of his red elk Yakult,
will defeat the angry boares that have kidnapped the princess.

How To Play:

With the arrows you can move forward, backwards, up and down.
With the C Key you can throw arrows, and you can jump with the space key.

Avoid or shoot the boars to gain points, catch the masks to gain lives...and have fun saving the princess!!
